# SICP Solutions in Clojure

## Readme
Here is my ongoing mission to solve all the problems in the epic [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
using Clojure. Where applicable I aim to complete the solutions in both a scheme style and an idiomatic clojure style.

This is for my own personal growth to learn clojure and be a better programmer, if anyone else finds it useful or has comments or criticisms let me know. :-)
